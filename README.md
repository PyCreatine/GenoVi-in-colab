# Colab Notebook for Setting Up GenoVi

## Overview
This Colab notebook provides an easy way to set up the GenoVi genome visualization library in a Google Colab environment. The main objective is to enable users to use GenoVi seamlessly without having to deal with installation issues.

## Downloading and Opening the Notebook

To download and open the `GenoVi_colab.ipynb` notebook, follow these steps:

1. Click on the `GenoVi_colab.ipynb` file in the repository.
2. Click on the `Raw` button to view the raw file.
3. Right-click on the page and select `Save as` to save the file to your computer.
4. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) in your web browser.
5. Click on `File` > `Upload notebook` and select the `GenoVi_colab.ipynb` file from your computer.
